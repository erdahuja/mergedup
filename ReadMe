Q. Build a Shopping cart API with following functionalities:
- Ability to create account with two roles (admin, user) and log in
- Admin should be able to
    - Add items
    - Suspend user
- User should be able to
    - List available items
    - Add items to a cart (if there are items in stock)
    - Remove items from their cart
- Restrict the access to APIs through RBAC mechanism
- Add unit test with extensive cases wherever possible (Bonus: E2E tests)
- Follow proper coding conventions and add documentation & code comments wherever necessary
- Create Readme for easy setup and testing of the API

Note: Candidates may use any coding language, though Golang would be preferable
